(Verse 1)
In the moonlit night, where shadows play,
Whispers in the breeze, they fade away.
Lost in a dream, chasing stars above,
Dancing with memories, falling in love.

(Chorus)
Oh, in the rhythm of the rain,
Heartbeats echo, no need to explain.
We're painting constellations in the sky,
A symphony of dreams, where time can't fly.

(Verse 2)
Through the tangled vines of yesterday,
We find our way, in the disarray.
Broken melodies, we mend the seams,
Building castles from our shattered dreams.

(Chorus)
Oh, in the rhythm of the rain,
Heartbeats echo, no need to explain.
We're painting constellations in the sky,
A symphony of dreams, where time can't fly.

(Bridge)
In the silence, where echoes linger,
We write the lyrics with our fingers.
A melody of hope, a verse untold,
In the book of life, our stories unfold.

(Verse 3)
Underneath the city lights so bright,
We're dancing through the chaos of the night.
In the echoes of our laughter, we find,
The magic of the moment, forever entwined.

(Chorus)
Oh, in the rhythm of the rain,
Heartbeats echo, no need to explain.
We're painting constellations in the sky,
A symphony of dreams, where time can't fly.
